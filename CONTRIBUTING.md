### How to contribute

If you want to add you code to project you should do next steps:
* Write tests for your code, coverage should be greather or equal 80 percents
* Run build ant it should be passed (phpcs + phpmd + tests)
* No code duplication (see phpcpd build logs)

### Build project localy
I use `apache ant` for building project https://ant.apache.org

`how to install ant?`
```bash
apt-get install ant
```

`how to run?`

Just one command
```bash
ant
```
